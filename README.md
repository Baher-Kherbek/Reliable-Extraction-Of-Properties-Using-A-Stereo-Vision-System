# Extracting-Fruit-Properties-to-Determine-Maturity


<h2> The Goal </h2>
The goal of the project is to extract properties of fruits(color and size) to use as criteria to determine fruit grade and maturity using modern and advanced moethods.

<h2> Methods Used </h2>
A Machine learning model was trained based on the <super>YOLOv6 detection</super> and classification algorithm, the model was trained on a dataset of multiple fruits obtained from the Kaggle Website. The YOLO algorithms outputs a bounding box as well as a classification for the fruit. After a bounding box is obtained, next is isolating the object within the bounding box, that was done using the <super>Grabcut Alogorithm</super>. After the object is completely isolated from the raw frame we can go ahead and work on extracting its Size(dimension) and Color. <super>The K-means Clustering algorithm</super> (which is an unsurpevised machine learning algorithm) was used to determine the K Dominant colors of the isolated fruit. For extracting the dimensions, the <super>disparity</super> method in the stereovision system was used. A Relationship between the disparity and a coefficient <super>alpha</super> is extracted, <super>alpha</super> multiplied by the length in pixels from the frame outputs the actual length in cm. The stereo camera used is (Camera Binoculars 3D-1mP02). The final step is to produce a threshold of the image in addition to morphological operations to remove any small noise present in the image and that is to ouput a crisp threshold of the isolated fruit for further procesing.
